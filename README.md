# Video-Games-Sales
Repository for data analysis for Video Games Sales dataset
This is my first repository in GitHub. 
If you are starting at Data Analytics or Data Science, you will probably get to know the Video Games Sales dataset. It is really common to find different versions of this dataset online at Kaggle.
I tried to use my own inspiration to clean out the data, to do the plots, to show the variables I believed where the most intresting ones.
Obviously there will be mistakes and lots of other statistics can be carried out. this was just a first approach.

Please read my MEDIUM story for this code.
